         <p>I was born in 1988 in Afghanistan and lived 29 years there. I moved here in the United States in early 2017. I always loved to study software development when I was in Afghanistan, but unfortunately we did not have any university/college to offer such a program. The only choice for me was to study aboard.</p> 
<p>But just being from Afghanistan is enough to miss all those opportunity, I applied for student visa in multiple countries. I fulfilled all program requirement, still I was not able to get my visa, all the time they would say “I can’t get student visa, because I might not return to Afghanistan.</p> 
<p>In 2009 I received my BA in Dari(Persian) literature. Right after I graduate, I joined the U.S Army and worked as Linguist and Cultural advisor.</p>
       <p>U.S Government offered translator the Special Immigration Visa (SIV) to come to the U.S, I applied and luckily I was approved and in February 2017 I came to beautiful Boise Idaho.
After I moved here, the first thing I did, start my college enrolment at CWI. 
Now here I am and working my way up to fulfill the old dream of studying software development.
